Version 0.1.4
	# LaTeX_Converter.pl:
	Updated "latex" call to accommodate new server architecture. A new
	temporary folder is now created under "/tmp", and all LaTeX operations are
	performed therein. All other operations are still performed in the user
	temporary directory.

	# template.tex
	Changes have been made to accommodate dynamically generated path to
	"fontsize.tex" and "equation.tex". An environment variable "\path" is
	defined by the LaTeX call from LaTeX_Converter.pl, and used to point to
	the appropriate files.

Version 0.1.3
	Updated handling of padding files. Padding files are now written to
	the subdirectory Process_LaTeX/temporary/(subdirectory) instead of to
	Process_LaTeX/temporary. The padding files are now cleaned after each
	call to LiW and recreated for each new job.
