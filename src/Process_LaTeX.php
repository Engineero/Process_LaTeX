# Program Name: Process_LaTeX.php
# Description:  Process_LaTeX is part of a system that duplicates some of the
#                 functionality of the Microsoft Word equation editor.  A Word
#                 macro calls this PHP script on a web server that subsequently
#                 calls a PERL script that converts its argument into a PNG
#                 image.  Refer to the PERL script for further documentation.
# Usage:        Process_LaTeX.php?formula=font_size.data[&dont_del=del_value]
#                 Where font_size is the desired LaTeX font size (10, 11, or
#                   12), data is a LaTeX formula that has been percent-encoded,
#                   and del_value is the boolean value (0 or 1) of dont_del.
#                 The dont_del option prevents the temporary files from being
#                   deleted after an error; this option defaults to 0 and would
#                   normally only be invoked for diagnostic purposes.

# Microsoft Word will not make the call to this PHP script if the URL (including
# the 'formula' argument) has already been called since Word was started.  This
# means that the correct PNG will not be (re)generated and the wrong image may 
# be loaded into Word.  This problem can be prevented by disabling caching with 
# the following line.
